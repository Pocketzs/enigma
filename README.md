# Enigma
###### Nigel Aung-Myint Final Project

## Self Assessment
##### Functionality
I think I would give myself a 4 since I got crack to work.  Or at least a 3.5.  The interaction pattern seems to suggest that you can crack any encryption only using todays date for crack, but if the encryption date and the crack date don't match, it is nigh impossible to create a key that follows the algorithm for key cipher.
##### OOP
Solid 2.9 probably.  I used modules and inheritence and I can explain why.  I can explain why my classes are the way they are.  But some of my methods are probably not single responsibility yet.  Way too tired to keep refactoring.
##### Ruby Convention and Mechanics
3.5 - 4 Hashes galore. None of my methods are longer than 10 lines. EVEN with block syntax.  I used hound so I hope my indents/style was consistent but I definitely got lazy. 
##### TDD
Maybe a a 3 or 2.5. Was way too tired by the end to try all edge cases.  But I used TDD the whole way and commited like crazy to show my paper trail.  I used stubs appropriately but didn't use mocks for my integrated tests.  I have 100% test coverage.

##### VC
Solid 3.  Not all my commits were single functionality but most were.  So many commits and branches.
